trail_erosion (Erode footsteps back to original soil type) bool true

#This setting works in combination with trail_hardpack_count. It gives the
#probability that a player stepping on a footprint will increment the hardpack
#counter. So by default, every time you step on a footprint there's a 1/2
#chance the counter increments for that node.

#This setting works in combination with trail_hardpack_probability. By default,
#once a footprint has been stepped on enough to increment its counter 5 times
#it'll turn the soil hard-packed.
